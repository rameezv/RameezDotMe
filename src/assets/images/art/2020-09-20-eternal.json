  "description": "You ever watch a show and then can't stop thinking about it? I rewatched one of my favourite shows \"Black Sails\" (it's amazing, like seriously go watch it) and was in a swashbuckling mood. I also wanted to paint something with meaning, so this one represents the eternal nature of... well, nature.
