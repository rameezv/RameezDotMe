  "description": "There's something about the feeling of being in a crowd at a show when everyone is fully engaged and having a good time. So many people from all many walks of life dancing in harmony to music that they all love - to me it's a fun reminder that we are all connected. It's been so long since I've fueled my concert addiction, so I painted this to transport myself back there. I'm proud to say I didn't use any reference photos for this one, it's completely freehanded!",
