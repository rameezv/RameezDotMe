  "name": "Flamenco Downtime",
  "description": "Another painting inspired by my trip to Spain a few years ago. My sister and I saw the most beautiful Flamenco show in Granada, and it's been on my mind ever since. The dancers expressed such elegant and confident beauty, while the guitarist's fingers danced along with them over the fretboard. And the singer's powerful voice brought it all together so magnificently. However, I found myself wondering if the female dancer ever tried any of the other roles out from time to time, and for some reason the idea of that seemed worth painting. Not sure exactly why.",
