  "description": "This piece is an expression of the transfer of generational knowledge that is enabled by the rich tradition of religious hymns. An older hand is passing down a ball of light (Nur) to a younger hand, symbolizing the teaching of Truth and Wisdom through generations. Inside the ball of light is a waveform representing the titular line from the Isma'ili gīnān (hymn) \"gīnān bolore nīt nure bharīy\" which roughly translates to \"recite gīnāns, for they are completely filled with Light\". In Ismailism, the Nur (Light) is the divine presence of Allah, and the essence from which the human soul is derived. Gīnāns are how generational wisdom and spiritual knowledge were traditionally passed down in Isma'ili history. This piece serves to show the power of knowledge transfer - the child's hand is more vibrant signifying how the knowledge is enriched each time it is inherited. The waveform is a visual representation of this powerful verse written by Pir Sadardin and shows how we can see a verse that is sung out loud, as well as see the power and role of the art of singing in faith and spirituality. Actually made this one for an exhibition but didn't read the criteria carefully enough and got disqualified for being too religious lol",
