  "description": "Childish Gambino/Donald Glover is the artist that really helped me grow up, especially the album Because The Internet. In some ways he's been like an older brother figure - he made me feel proud of being able to code, helped me come to terms with my depression, and showed me that people aren't limited to greatness in only one thing. This painting is from the video for This Is America, but I tried a technique where I only considered the values of colours, not their tone. There's a saying in art \"value does all the work and colour gets all the credit\" - this style to me represents a challenging of conventions with a successful result which I feel Gambino really exemplifies. And This Is America felt incredibly relevant at the time as the Capitol Riots were still unravelling, showing truly how ingrained racism is into America's institutions.",
