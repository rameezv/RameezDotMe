  "description": "Spent an entire day looking at swans and koi fish. Like I'm not kidding, about 6 straight hours in the same park just listening to music (shoutout my Sony xm3s) and staring at the swans. I think people forget that swans are just bigger, more pretty geese. But the increase in prettiness comes with an increase of attitude. Swans are assholes! I saw one run towards a little girl while flapping its wings, and the poor girl fell over and let out a horrific scream. I saw the same swan attack a duck and steal its food. 6 hours of observation and I came to the conclusion that these are the evilest creatures in North America, besides humans.",
