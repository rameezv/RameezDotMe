  "description": "Seasonal Affective Disorder was REAL this past February. I really wanted to get my hiking fix in but it was like -20Â° out. So I decided to paint one of my favourite views in Kananaskis: the view from Prairie View Trail/Jewell Pass, looking out over Barrier Lake while the larches were just turning gold last summer. It almost felt like God had attacked the scene with a golden paintbrush. You can't see it on the gram, but I used metallic paint for the gold trees to make it shine and reflect how it felt to see such a gorgeous sight.",
