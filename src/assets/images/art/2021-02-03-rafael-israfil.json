  "description": "This is actually just an experiment in recreating a picture I took in Córdoba, Spain. Rafael is the Angel of Healing and the patron guardian of Córdoba. This statue can be found on the city's Roman Bridge right next to where my sister puked up an entire meal from Burger King over the side. Fittingly, this made her feel better as that greasy food did not sit well with her at all. Maybe Rafael was healing her too.",
