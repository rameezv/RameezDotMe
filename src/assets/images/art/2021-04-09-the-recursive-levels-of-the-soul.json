  "name": "The Recursive Levels of the Soul",
  "description": "Isma'ili theology believes that there are different abstract levels to the soul, beginning with mineral, then vegetative, then animal, then human/rational, then beyond. This represents the connection of all of our souls to the Universal Soul, and the souls of all matter around us. In scientific terms, this is in effect different manifestations of energy in matter. This piece also pays homage to Sura an-Nur, which speaks of the light of God. The lamp is a reference to the niche of a lamp that stays lit though no fire touched it, and the trees refer to the olive tree neither of the East nor West.",
